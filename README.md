# 5 Day Weather Forecast

## How to Run

In the server folder run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

In the client folder, run:

```
npm install
npm run dev

```

You should now be able to view the project on http://localhost:8080.

To build the bundle for the dist folder, run:

```
npm run build
```

## Deployed Example

The client is hosted on [netlify](https://eager-murdock-f5c9ef.netlify.com/).  The service recognizes it as a React app and the dist folder is all that is needed to serve the client files.

The server is hosted on heroku at https://fivedayforecastserver.herokuapp.com.

## Thought Process

I wanted the app to provide a quick overview at the top and then allow users to see more detail at the bottom if they were interested.
